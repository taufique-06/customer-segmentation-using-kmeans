# Customer Segmentation using kmeans

This project uses unsupervised learning techniques — specifically the K-Means clustering algorithm — to perform customer segmentation. By analyzing patterns in customers’ annual income and spending scores, we can divide them into meaningful groups that share similar buying behavior. In the second part, instead of two features, we take three features annual income, spending scores and ages.

### Result Analysis
1. Cluster 1: High-income, high-spending → premium customers
2. Cluster 2: High-income, low-spending → potential targets
3. Cluster 3: Low-income, high-spending → loyal or impulsive buyers
4. Cluster 4: Low-income, low-spending → budget customers
5. Cluster 5: Average income and spending → moderate group
